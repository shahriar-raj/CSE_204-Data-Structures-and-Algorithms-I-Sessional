# CSE 204: Data Structures and Algorithms I Sessional

This repository contains all home and lab assignments for the **CSE 204: Data Structures and Algorithms I Sessional** course, part of the Term-1, Level-2 curriculum at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). The course emphasizes applying theories from **CSE 203: Data Structures and Algorithms I** to practical problem-solving, focusing on implementing data structures without utilizing the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Course Overview

**CSE 204** is a 0.75 credit hour sessional course intended for Level 2 Term 1 students. It serves as a practical extension of **CSE 203**, allowing students to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to various data structures and algorithms implemented during the course:

- **Offline Assignments**: Contains implementations of data structures and algorithms assigned as homework.
- **Online Assignments**: Includes code developed during lab sessions, focusing on real-time problem-solving.

## Implemented Topics

The course covers a range of fundamental data structures and algorithms, including:

- **List**: Implementation of dynamic arrays and linked lists.
- **Stack**: Development of stack data structures using arrays and linked lists.
- **Queue**: Creation of queue structures, including circular queues.
- **Graph**: Algorithms for graph traversal and pathfinding, such as BFS and DFS.
- **Heap**: Implementation of binary heaps for priority queue operations.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Various sorting techniques, including quicksort, mergesort, and introsort.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Problem-solving strategies that make locally optimal choices.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Techniques for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Algorithms that divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine their solutions.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have completed **CSE 203: Data Structures and Algorithms I**, which provides the theoretical foundation for this sessional course.

## Contributors

The assignments and projects in this repository were developed by Shahriar Raj as part of the CSE 204 course at BUET.
