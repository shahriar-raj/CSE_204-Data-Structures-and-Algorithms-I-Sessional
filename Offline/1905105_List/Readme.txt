****----------------------------------------------Assignment-1 : List------------------------------------------------------------------****

There are 5 java files. (4 public class and 1 interface. LL class has 1 nested class)

1.List - This is basically an interface which holds all the public functions that the Arr.java and LL.java implements and the users can use.
	 There are 13 functions which are public to the users.

2.Arr -  This has a public Arr<T> class. Here all the functions that are declared in list are implemented. It implements list interface.
	 And these functions are implemented with the help of arrays.And this is a generic class 
	 which means it can be used for any data types(i.e. Integer, Double, String etc.).

3.LL  -  This has a public LL<T> class. Here all the functions that are declared in list are implemented. It implements list interface.
	 And these functions are implemented with the help of linked list.And this is a generic class 
	 which means it can be used for any data types(i.e. Integer, Double, String etc.). This includes a nested class named "Node".

4.TNL - TNL class has a main function. TNL uses the Arr & LL implementation and designs a network line.

5.Main - Main also has a main function. This is a piece of code that demonstrates the output or test results of Arr and LL implementations.
